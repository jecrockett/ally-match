### Description
Ally-Match is a simple memory match game built in JavaScript and dedicated to my dog Ally.

### How to Play
Navigate to ```ally-match.herokuapp.com```, log in with Facebook, and give it your best shot!

### Challenges
This was my first exposure to Facebook OAuth and first time updating records via AJAX (which I use to update your high score.)
